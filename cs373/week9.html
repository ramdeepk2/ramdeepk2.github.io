    <h3 class="question">What did you do this past week?</h3>
    <p>
        This past week I spent a lot of time studying for my a Randomized Algorithms exam and various assignments for other courses. Over the weekend I got to go hiking, which was a lot of fun. Aside, from that, this week was like most other weeks, in that I'm swamped with work and have to find open time slots to be able to get things done. 
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What's in your way?</h3>
    <p>
        Lack of time, as I spoke about in the previous question. Not too much apart from that. I am enjoying my semester despite its challenges, but at the same time, I can't wait for it to be over.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What will you do next week?</h3>
    <p>
        Start working on phase 3. The first thing I need to do is get travis CI set up for our group. I'm hoping it goes a lot more smoothly than it did during the Collatz project, as I remember having to commit and push my code several times just to get a passing build. The problem was with a poorly formatted travis yml file, so I shouldn't have the same problem this time. For my other classes, I have a couple of assignments. I have to implement image mosaics in MATLAB using image warping and homographies for my Computer Vision class, and I have to learn how to use Intel's VTune software to do program performance analysis (for Programming for Performance).
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What's my experience of the class?</h3>
    <p>
        My experience is the same as it has always been: pretty positive. I would enjoy this class more if there was more time to really experiment with things in the projects, but because so much of the project is complex and challenging as it is, if you take any time to experiment, you will probably end up falling behind. Nevertheless, the projects are useful.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
    <p>
        My pick of the week this week is a fairly simple one: get outside! Not to stereotype, but it might be hard for some of us to find time to do this, what with all the projects we have to complete and code we have to write. I think we all know its worth it, though. Going hiking last weekend was one of the high points of my week, and I hope everyone gets opportunities like that throughout the semester and even after college.
