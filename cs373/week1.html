    <h1 class="center">CS 373 Spring 2018: Krishna Ramdeep</h1>

    <h3 class="question">1. What are your expectations of the class?</h3>
    <p>
        My main expectation for the class is to learn how to use the tools that we'll be using
        this semester, especially Amazon Web Services, SQLAlchemy, and RESTful APIs. I am already pretty
        familiar with Python, but not so much with JavaScript, so hopefully I'll pick up
        a few things about that along the way.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">2. What did you do this past week?</h3>
    <p>
        This week was pretty relaxing for me. I already had my schedule sorted out, so all
        that was left for me to do was order a few textbooks. I loved having Tuesday off as
        well--it made my whole morning when I got the text notification. Aside from that, I'm
        trying to develop a consistent morning routine, but it's just <em>so cold</em> that
        I keep hitting the snooze button without hesitation.

    <h3 class="question">3. What's in your way?</h3>
    <p>
        Struggling to get back into a rhythm after a month off. Hopefully it won't take
        too long to get settled in as soon as the work starts piling up, or I could be in trouble.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">4. What will you do next week?</h3>
    <p>
        My semester truly begins from next week, as I'll be swamped with programming
        assignments. I'll try to get things done as quickly as possible, but we'll see
        how it goes. As of right now, I only have a Computer Vision assignment due on
        Tuesday.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">5. What's my experience of the class?</h3>
    <p>
        I am really enjoying it so far. We haven't gone over anything really new yet, but it
        is just the first week. The random (is it truly random?) calling on students
        was a little unsettling at first, but it doesn't seem too bad. It feels like a
        prize drawing, but I've never won one of those, so I may never get picked. If,
        by some miniscule chance, I <em>do</em> get picked next class, then it's a safe bet that
        Professor Downing saw this and decided to snap me out of my false sense of security.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">6. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
    <p>
        If you're having trouble with Docker, try using a virtual machine instead.
        I've used Oracle's <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a>
        for other classes, and found it relatively simple to set up and use. I am not sure
        how valuable Docker or VirtualBox will be, but I'll wait until I know what all the
        projects are about before making any final judgement.
