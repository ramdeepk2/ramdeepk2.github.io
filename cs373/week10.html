    <h1 class="center">CS 373 Spring 2018: Krishna Ramdeep</h1>

    <h3 class="question">What did you do this past week?</h3>
    <p>
        This past week I spent a lot of time refining the backend tests for our group's project. I also spent a lot of time working on my project for Computer Vision, which has to do with image mosaics and RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus, "an iterative method to estimate parameters of a mathematical model from a set of observed data that contains outliers, when outliers are to be accorded no influence on the values of the estimates" -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sample_consensus">Wikipedia</a>).
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What's in your way?</h3>
    <p>
        Lack of time, as usual. Taking four computer science courses in one semester is rough--I don't recommend it unless you have no choice or you're a sucker for pain. I also need to figure out how to set up selenium tests to run properly within Travis CI--I'm using headless firefox, but I have a problem where the tests run and pass perfectly on a local machine, but for some reason time out when they run on Travis. If you have dealt with this issue and have any advice for me, I would greatly appreciate it.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What will you do next week?</h3>
    <p>
        More work. Set up selenium on Travis. Edit the technical report to add information about the new sections (filtering, searching, and sorting). Other CS assignments. I also have to watch a film for my global cultures course--Rabbi Jacob, a French film. It is a comedy (came out in the 1970s, I believe), so hopefully it's an enjoyable watch.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What's my experience of the class?</h3>
    <p>
        This question is harder and harder to come up with unique answers for. Overall, my experience has been positive. I enjoy Python, SQL, and Java, so I'm looking forward to the rest of the course. The projects are tough, as usual. If I could go back in time, though, I'd probably tell my past self not to take this course because of the high workload and the fact that I have three other computer science courses this semester. That was an oversight on my part.

    <h3 class="question">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
    <p>
        My pick of the week/tip of the week this week is sleep. Get some. It's really good for you. If you don't believe me, look at this: <a target=”_blank” href=”http://www.google.com/search?q=benefits+of+sleep”>info</a>. Enjoy! Aside from that, enjoy your week, guys. Summer's almost here.
