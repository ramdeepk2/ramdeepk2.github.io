    <h3 class="question">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
    <p>
        My pick of the week/tip of the week this week is the song "Douce France (Sweet France)" by Charles Trenet (1943) and Rachid Taha (1986). Trenet sang it first in 1943, and the song is about Trenet's youth growing up in the country before World War 2. In 1986 the Algerian-French group Carte de Sejour (translated as "Green Card"), led by singer Rachid Taha, remade the song. While the lyrics remain the same, the music video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRwpjFW82G8">here</a>) paints a country that is much different from Trenet's view. The music video for the remake definitely looks like it come out of the 1980s. I had to watch it for my French history class as we studied the life of immigrants coming to France from its former colonies in the period following the Algerian War (which ran from 1954 to 1962), after which Algeria won its independence from France. The remade song speaks to the political and social changing of the status quo requested by the "Beur (pronounced almost like "Burr") generation", which refers to the French-born descendants of immigrants from North Africa. In the 80s, this social group shook up the political scene and demanded a more egalitarian and less racially discriminatory France. The song was banned from French radio, and the singer (Taha) was described as a "scruffy, bohemian-looking Arabic singer" (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/may/28/artsfeatures1">source</a>).
