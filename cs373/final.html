    <h1 class="center">CS 373 Spring 2018: Krishna Ramdeep [Final Entry]</h1>

    <h3 class="question">What did you like the least about the class?</h3>
    <p>
        I disliked the refactoring part of the course. I see the use of it, but it wasn't very interesting, unlike the majority of the other lectures.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What did you like the most about the class?</h3>
    <p>
        I really enjoyed the SQL lectures and the emphasis on unit testing in the class. I thought both parts were interesting and useful. I'm not the biggest fan of selenium, but learning Postman, Python's unittest library, and mocha was great.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What's the most significant thing you learned?</h3>
    <p>
        The importance of contributing when you're working in a group. That really transcends the course, and I definitely learned a lot about it through the projects in this course.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">How many hours a week did you spend coding for this class?</h3>
    <p>
        Around 6 most weeks, but kick that up to around 15 on weeks when the projects were due.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">How many hours a week did you spend reading for this class?</h3>
    <p>
        In the interest of being completely honest, I stopped reading after the SQL stuff. I didn't find the refactoring book interesting at all, and it seemed like towards the end of the course, Professor Downing started giving less questions over the reading in the daily quizzes, so there wasn't really any incentive.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">How many lines of code do you think you wrote?</h3>
    <p>
        Easily over 1000. I was in charge of testing and documentation, so most of my writing was "actual" writing, in English, attempting to communicate effectively with a user. I have no idea how many lines of text I wrote.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?</h3>
    <p>
        I mentioned selenium, mocha, and postman already. Add Flask-SQLAlchemy, SQL in general, and python generators.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What's the most useful Web dev tool that your group used that was not required?</h3>
    <p>
        Travis CI. It helped us keep track of when our database was down during IDB phase 3 (project #4). It's not <i>technically</i> required (a TA told me that it wasn't really part of the grade on the assignments), but it's really easy to set up and quite useful.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">If you could change one thing about the course, what would it be?</h3>
    <p>
        I'd rearrange some of the requirements for the projects. Maybe give os one less week on the final phase of IDB, and add on that week to phase 2 or phase 3, because those are rough. Also, I know that Professor Downing told us from day 1 that the lectures wouldn't help <i>too</i> much with the projects, but I really would have appreciated more information/help with docker from Professor Downing/the TAs during class time (the TA review sessions were useful, but could we get 2 per project instead of just 1?).
