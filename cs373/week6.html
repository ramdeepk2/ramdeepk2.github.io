    <h1 class="center">CS 373 Spring 2018: Krishna Ramdeep</h1>

    <h3 class="question">What did you do this past week?</h3>
    <p>
        Most of my time was spent working on an assignment for my Computer Vision class and IDB2. For IDB2, I met with my group and we assigned responsibilities this week. I am part of the back end team, which means I'll be working on setting up the database and designing, implementing, and testing our API with Flask and Postman.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What's in your way?</h3>
    <p>
        I need to manage my time really well this week (as usual). I've never really set up a database for a site before, so I'll have to learn a little bit of PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy. Also, JavaScript. I really need to get used to the syntax and intricacies of that language before the exam.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What will you do next week?</h3>
    <p>
        IDB2, finishing up my Vision assignment, other homework. I will probably play around with Postman this week in order to figure out exactly how our group will move forward with our API design. I might go to the Atlassian talk, since an extra attendance quiz could be useful.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What's my experience of the class?</h3>
    <p>
        My experience hasn't really changed from last week. I'm not too worried about the exam, but I definitely need to brush up on my JavaScript.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
    <p>
        My pick of the week this week is the Harry Ransom Center, which is located really close to the building in which we have lecture. I went there recently with my French history class to look at the Description of Egypt, a set of volumes about Egypt from the perspective of French scholars and scientists who visited the country with Napoleon from 1798 to 1801. The whole experience is really fascinating, especially since the volumes we got to look at were authentic. Despite their age, the artwork (mostly of architectural structures, flora, and fauna) and technical diagrams we saw were incredible. You can read some more about it here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Description_de_l%27%C3%89gypte">Wikipedia</a>. A fun fact is that these volumes are absolutely <i>massive</i>, and I don't just mean in terms of the number of pages. The length and width of the books were gigantic. I've never seen anything like it. The Description of Egypt is not open to the public, but if you ever get a chance to see it, don't miss out!
