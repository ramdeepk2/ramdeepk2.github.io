    <h1 class="center">CS 373 Spring 2018: Krishna Ramdeep</h1>

    <h3 class="question">What did you do this past week?</h3>
    <p>
        This past week I got hit with fairly lengthy assignments in all my classes. I managed to finish up this project (all that's left is for me to submit) and my Computer Vision assignment, but I still have a Randomized Algorithms homework due on Monday that I have yet to start on. Hopefully it won't take too long.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What's in your way?</h3>
    <p>
        Nothing so far. I'm sure that'll change soon, especially since our first group project for the class should be starting up soon, but I'm still pretty positive about the semester and am really enjoying
        all my courses so far.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What will you do next week?</h3>
    <p>
        Next week will basically be a repeat of this week. Attend classes, get work done, go home, eat, sleep. I'll probably break up the monotony by checking out a few of the student orgs. If you have any recommendations, let me know! I'm interested in pretty much everything.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What's my experience of the class?</h3>
    <p>
        I am really enjoying it so far. The Collatz project was kind of hit
        and miss for me, though. While I understood why we went so overboard on using all these tools (TravisCI) and features of already familiar software (Github issues, creating multiple remotes, HackerRank), it just felt like too much, and made me wonder if this is even the best way to get us to use these things. Shouldn't the assignment make us feel that these features and tools are helpful, so we don't need encouragement to use them in the future? For this project, they just felt like a chore. It's like programming mergesort to sort a list with 2 numbers in it.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
    <p>
        I'm predicting that a lot of my picks-of-the-week and tips-of-the-week will come from my Computer Vision class, as I find that area of study really interesting. This week, I'll talk a little bit about dynamically resizing images. Anyone that has edited pictures before will know that if you resize an image without maintaining the aspect ratio, it gets distorted. However, through a
        process known as seam carving (also known as retargeting), we can resize images while mitigating the effects of the distortion. I won't get too technical here, but check out this very, very, old video about the idea behind it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NcIJXTlugc">youtube</a>.
