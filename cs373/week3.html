    <h1 class="center">CS 373 Spring 2018: Krishna Ramdeep</h1>

    <h3 class="question">What did you do this past week?</h3>
    <p>
        I worked. A lot. I had multiple assignments due, so all of last week was spent in the lab. Aside from that, I think I'm finally back into the swing of things. I've almost got my routine sorted out, the only exception being my group's meeting times for this class.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What's in your way?</h3>
    <p>
        As I mentioned earlier, I need to figure out what times I'll be meeting my group to work on the projects for this class. I also need to make some time to do the readings for this class. The only other things in my way are the regular: assignments in other classes, projects, et cetera.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What will you do next week?</h3>
    <p>
        Work on all my assignments. I don't have anything too special planned for next week, so hopefully I can survive the monotony.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What's my experience of the class?</h3>
    <p>
        I am really enjoying it so far. The quizzes are a little tougher than I expected them to be when the semester began, but almost all of my mistakes have come from rushing through the problems, so I'll take them more slowly from now on. I'm not a huge fan of the Extreme Programming textbook, as I feel like
        the whole thing could have been written up as a technical document in less than 50 pages instead of a full-blown book, but if it is a software development paradigm that's used in industry, I'll take this opportunity to get used to it without complaining (too much).
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
    <p>
        My pick of the week this week actually comes from the Extreme Programming textbook, because I feel it will be good to keep in mind for the upcoming project. We will probably be required to connect to a database as part of this project, and we will most definitely have to write tests, so the following tip (taken from chapter 13 of the Extreme Programming Installed book) helps answer the question: How do you efficiently test when your program requires
        database connection? The answer: Test functionality by taking input from pre-created files. This keeps your tests fast and still ensures that you're doing things properly. As for the database connection itself, have a single test to make sure that your code connects to and reads from it properly, just to be safe.
