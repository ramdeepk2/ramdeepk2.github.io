    <h1 class="center">CS 373 Spring 2018: Krishna Ramdeep</h1>

    <h3 class="question">What did you do this past week?</h3>
    <p>
        This past week I spent a lot of time reviewing JavaScript syntax for the exam on Thursday. Aside from that, I had a couple of short meetings with members of my group, just to keep up-to-date on what we're getting done. In my "free time", I completed assignments for my other CS courses. 
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What's in your way?</h3>
    <p>
        I have two exams next week (one on Monday, and one on Thursday). I'll have to spend most of the week studying for those while finding time to contribute to this project. Hopefully I can manage my time effectively.
    </p>

    <h3 class="question">What will you do next week?</h3>
    <p>
        Phase 2, finishing up my Vision assignment, other homework, including another Programming for Performance project. As usual, the classwork piles up. I'll be leaving for Spring Break either early Saturday or late Friday (depending on when my group wants to meet), so at least I'll have that to look forward to after my exams.

    <h3 class="question">What's my experience of the class?</h3>
    <p>
        My experience hasn't really changed from last week. I'm very glad the exam is over (I think I did pretty well on it, too), but the panic to get phase 2 done is slowly starting to set in. I'm really enjoying the weekly readings now, especially since we've moved away from the extreme programming book, which I never really liked.

    <h3 class="question">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
    <p>
        My pick of the week this week is xG (also known as expected goals). It is a relatively new metric used by soccer analysts to evaluate a team's offensive output. It is very simple to understand (especially if you've read <i>Moneyball</i> (if you haven't, please do)). Whenever a player on a particular team takes a shot towards the opponents goal, computers will look through historical data to find shots similar to the one being taken (for example, similar distance from goal, angle, goalie's position, etc.). Based on the outcomes of these  historical goals, the shot is given a score between 0 and 1 (the higher the better). The measure has proven to be very good at predicting scores of matches, and is used to analyze individual players as well. While it has it's limitations (for example, excellent offensive play that does not lead to a shot will not contribute towards a team's xG), it is a very powerful tool for soccer analytics and very interesting to read about.
